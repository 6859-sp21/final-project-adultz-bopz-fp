## Abstract
`// TODO `

## Development Process
For our Final Project, we chose to extend our work from A4, which created an interactive hiearchical data visualization to analyzes how songs by different artists are filtered.

### Nico
- Starting early setup for tree-map (with no interaction and animation).
- Used `d3.group` and `d3.rollup` to create a similar hiearchical data structure to build our treemap
- Separated raw dataset by using nonminal category field (six different fields in total). Treemap is actually categorized into three separate 
- Started working on modal popup for treemap to show all data associated with a certain word in a certain year
- Introduced a profanity filter for treemap visualization (and applied it retroactively to bubble visualization). 

### Shannen: 
- 

### Jessica: 
- Created a tooltip that gives more context on how many times a word has been altered in Kidz Bop songs.
- Create the legend for the treemap that is sorted from the largest category of altered words to the least.
- Helped style the modal popup for the treemap to match the style for the popup in the bubble popup.
- Introduced a color legend for the bubble visualization
- Changed the color of word bubbles to match the legend.
